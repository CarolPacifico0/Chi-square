# Chi-square
**Project Overview**

As part of a freelancer project, a dataset was analyzed to examine the association between tobacco use and financial status, as well as tobacco use and gender.

For the **first analysis** (tobacco use vs. financial status), **the null hypothesis was accepted** , indicating no significant relationship.

For the s**econd analysis** (tobacco use vs. gender), **the null hypothesis was rejected**, suggesting a significant association.

To enhance data visualization, a heatmap and a chart were created to better illustrate the results. The findings showed that, in this sample, males used tobacco more frequently than females, with a ratio of 48:15.
